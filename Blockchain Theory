Define blockchain in your own words
Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records data in a secure, tamper-proof manner. It stores information in units called blocks, where each block contains a set of transactions, a timestamp, a unique hash, and the hash of the previous block. These blocks are linked together in chronological order, forming a chain. Because each block references the one before it, altering any block would require changing all subsequent blocks — a process that is computationally expensive and practically infeasible. This makes blockchain highly secure and transparent. Unlike traditional databases controlled by a central authority, blockchains operate on a peer-to-peer network where all participants (nodes) have a copy of the ledger and collectively validate changes through consensus mechanisms. Blockchain technology is widely used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but its potential extends to industries like supply chain management, digital identity, and healthcare for enhancing trust and data integrity.
List 2 real-life use cases
Supply Chain Management
Blockchain improves transparency and traceability in supply chains. Each step of a product’s journey — from raw material to delivery — can be recorded as a block. This ensures that data cannot be tampered with and helps detect counterfeit products. For example, Walmart uses blockchain to trace the origin of food items like mangoes in seconds, enhancing food safety.
Digital Identity Verification
Blockchain can store and verify digital identities securely. Instead of relying on centralized databases, users can control their personal information and share it only with authorized parties. This reduces identity theft and fraud. For instance, Estonia uses blockchain to manage its national ID system, allowing citizens to securely access government and banking services online.
Block Anatomy
A block in a blockchain contains several key components:
Data – The actual content being stored (e.g., transactions, digital records).

Previous Hash – The hash of the previous block, linking the blocks together.

Timestamp – The exact time when the block was created.

Nonce – A number used to find a valid hash in Proof of Work.

Merkle Root – A hash that summarizes all transactions in the block for integrity verification.

 Draw a block showing:data,previous hash,timestamp, nonce, and Merkle root.
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│         Block               │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Data: [Tx1, Tx2, Tx3...]    │
│ Timestamp: 08/06/2025 12:30 │
│ Nonce: 27456                │
│ Previous Hash: ab3f2...1d9  │
│ Merkle Root: 9a7b4...e32    │
└─────────────────────────────┘
Briefly explain with an example how the Merkle root helps verify data integrity.
The Merkle root is a single hash that represents all the transactions in a block. It is derived by hashing pairs of transactions repeatedly until one final hash remains. This final hash is the Merkle root.
If even a single transaction changes, its hash will change. This change will then alter the parent hash, and eventually the Merkle root will be different. This makes it easy to detect tampering without checking every transaction individually.
Suppose a block has 4 transactions:
Tx1, Tx2, Tx3, and Tx4
Hash each: H1 = hash(Tx1), H2 = hash(Tx2), etc.
Combine pairs: H12 = hash(H1 + H2), H34 = hash(H3 + H4)
Final Merkle root: Root = hash(H12 + H34)
Consensus Conceptualization
Consensus mechanisms help blockchain networks agree on which transactions are valid, even without a central authority. Here’s a brief overview of the three main types:
What is Proof of Work and why does it require energy?
1. Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of Work requires participants (called miners) to solve complex mathematical puzzles using computational power. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add the new block to the blockchain and earn a reward.
 It requires a lot of energy because miners compete by running power-hungry hardware to perform trillions of hash calculations.
 Example: Bitcoin uses PoW.
What is Proof of Stake and how does it differ?
2. Proof of Stake (PoS)
In Proof of Stake, validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they "stake" or lock up as collateral. The higher the stake, the higher the chance to validate a block and earn rewards.
 It’s energy-efficient compared to PoW because it doesn’t involve heavy computation.
 Example: Ethereum switched to PoS with Ethereum 2.0.
What is Delegated Proof of Stake and how are validators selected?
3. Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
In DPoS, token holders vote to elect a small number of trusted delegates or validators who are responsible for validating transactions and creating new blocks.
 This makes the process faster and more democratic, but slightly more centralized.
 Example: EOS uses DPoS where only 21 validators are elected at a time.
