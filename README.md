# Blockchain Simulation Project

This repository contains three simulations for understanding the basics of blockchain, mining, and consensus mechanisms.

---

## 1. `blockchain_simulation.py`
- Builds a simple blockchain with 3 blocks.
- Shows how changing one block affects the rest.
- Demonstrates immutability and the importance of hash chaining.

## 2. `mining_simulation.py`
- Simulates Proof-of-Work mining.
- Tries to find a hash with a given difficulty (`0000...`).
- Displays number of attempts and time taken.

## 3. `consensus_demo.py`
- Simulates and compares three consensus mechanisms:
  - Proof of Work (PoW)
  - Proof of Stake (PoS)
  - Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
